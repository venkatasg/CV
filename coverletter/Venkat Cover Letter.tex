\opening{Dear X,}


I am a Ph.D candidate in the Department of Linguistics at The University of Texas at Austin (graduating in Spring 2024), advised by Dr. Jessy Li and Dr. David Beaver. My research focuses on interpersonal biases in online communication, especially whether these biases manifest through subtle systematic variations in semantic and pragmatic attributes of words and sentences. Previously, I have studied how individuals perform pragmatic acts online (like giving advice), as well as the diversity of generalizations available across different predicate-argument structures, both of which inform my research work now.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back form you.




\closing{Sincerely,}
