I am a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in Computational Linguistics at UT Austin graduating in Spring 2024. I am studying interpersonal biases in language use online through computational modeling. I have 5+ years of experience with large-scale data analysis and modeling, supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, and modern NLP  including large language models.
