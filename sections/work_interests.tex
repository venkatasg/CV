I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Computational Linguistics at UT Austin studying interpersonal biases in language use online. Previously, I have studied how individuals perform pragmatic acts like giving advice online, worked on unsupervised methods for detecting data drift in NLU models, and surveyed the diversity of generalizations available across predicates and arguments.\\
My goal for a Data Science internship at the NY Times is to use my expertise with modeling large data to unearth hidden structure and communicating these insights clearly to work on projects in personalization, customer retention, and customer satisfaction.
