I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Computational Linguistics at UT Austin studying interpersonal biases in language use online. My current work focuses on modeling semantic attributes of text that systematically vary with changing social dynamics in online conversations. Previously, I have studied how individuals perform pragmatic acts like giving advice online, as well as the diversity of generalizations available across predicates and arguments.\\
My goal for a summer internship at Abridge is to use my experience with language variation and generalization to work on research projects that can improve core products and technologies at the company like structured summarization, ultimately leading to a publishable paper.
