I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Linguistics at UT Austin (\emph{graduating Spring 2024}) studying intergroup biases in online communication. I have 5+ years of experience with data science, machine learning, and modern NLP including large language models. I'm interested in roles at the intersection of engineering, data science, and machine learning, with a \emph{start date in June 2024}.
