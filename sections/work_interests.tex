I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Computational Linguistics at UT Austin studying interpersonal biases in language use online. Previously, I have studied how individuals perform pragmatic acts like giving advice online, worked on unsupervised methods for detecting data drift in NLU models, and surveyed the diversity of generalizations in English.\\
My goal for an Machine Learning/AI internship at Apple is to use my expertise in NLP and NLU to work on projects that enrich user experience and customer satisfaction with Apple's products and services, like Siri and Spotlight.
