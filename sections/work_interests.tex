I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Computational Linguistics at UT Austin studying interpersonal biases in language use online. Previously, I have studied how individuals perform pragmatic acts like giving advice online, worked on unsupervised methods for detecting data drift in NLU models, and surveyed the diversity of generalizations in English.
