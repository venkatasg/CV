  {\large South by Semantics Workshop}{2022--2024}{I am co-organizing \href{https://sites.utexas.edu/sxsemantics/}{a series of talks} on semantics, computation and philosophy of language with Samuel Cantor, a graduate student in philosophy. To provide a forum for emerging scholars with UT Austin's rich community of language researchers, we invited 5 early career researchers to present their work during the 2022-2023 academic year, with more planned this year. We procured funding of 8000\$ from the College of Liberal Arts, the Graduate School, and the Linguistics \& Philosophy departments, and also  organized receptions after the talks to foster dialogue and collaboration.}
