  {\large South by Semantics Workshop}{2022--2024}{I am co-organizing \href{https://sites.utexas.edu/sxsemantics/}{a series of talks} on semantics, computation and philosophy of language with Samuel Cantor, a graduate student in philosophy. As part of our goal fostering community and increased collaboration between linguistics and philosophy, we invited 8 speakers from around the USA to present their work during the 2022-2023 academic year. We procured funding of 8000\$ from the College of Liberal Arts, the Graduate School, and our respective departments, and organized receptions after the talks.}
