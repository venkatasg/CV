I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Linguistics at UT Austin \emph{expecting to graduate in May 2024}. I am interested in \textbf{Natural Language Processing}, \textbf{Computational Pragmatics \& Social Science}, with a focus on social dynamics (like intergroup bias) in online conversation and communication.
