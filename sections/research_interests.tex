I am a PhD candidate in Computational Linguistics at UT Austin, with a focus on Computational Pragmatics. My dissertation will focus on interpersonal biases in language use, where I plan to probe deep neural nets to validate psychological hypotheses of how stereotypes persist in language use, and understand how interpersonal biases manifest in language generated by LLMs.
