I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Computational Linguistics at UT Austin studying interpersonal bias in language use online. My current work focuses on modeling semantic attributes of text that systematically vary with changing social dynamics in online conversations.\\
Previously, I have studied how individuals perform pragmatic acts like giving advice online, worked on unsupervised methods for detecting data drift in NLU models, and surveyed the diversity of generalizations available across predicates and arguments in the English language.
