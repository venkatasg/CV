I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Linguistics at UT Austin \emph{expecting to graduate in May 2024}. I am interested in \textbf{computational social science and pragmatics}, with a focus on social dynamics (like intergroup bias) in online communication. I have also studied how individuals perform pragmatic acts like giving advice, and surveyed the diversity of generalizations available across predicates and arguments in English.
