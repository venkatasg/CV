I am a Ph.D. candidate in \textbf{Computational Linguistics} at UT Austin \emph{expecting to graduate in May 2024}. I am interested in \textbf{Pragmatics}, \textbf{Computational Social Science}, and \textbf{Natural Language Processing}, with a focus on social dynamics (like intergroup bias) in communication.
